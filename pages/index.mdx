# About me

Hello I'm Nate, a software engineer

This site will be a bit of a portfolio eventually but initially it will be more
of a place for self improvement.

I read somewhere that the best way to improve the way you think, and expresse
your thoughts is to write. As a software developer, that is probably the #1
skill to rule them all. All day I am thinking and talking with a team, and
writing code that is trying to explain my thoughts both to a machine and my
future self or anyone else who will read that code. If I can improve any small
bit in this area it will have large effects in my life.

I have a great appreciation for the infomation that is available on the web
