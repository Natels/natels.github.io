# Tactics Reality

A dev log of progress made on my Tactics AR game.

### What am I doing..?

About three weeks ago Apple announced a new product category that
I have been waiting to see for a very long time. Finally the long rumored
AR device has been announced! And while it's current form is (or seems) a
little more limited than I had hoped, I am confident that Apple is
capable of tackling those issues in future versions. It is a very exciting
time to be an Apple platform developer! What amazing new things will we
be able to build with this new hardware?

I have wanted to publish an app for a long time. I have built several apps
for clients, and know much of what goes into building an application.
But there is a lot more to a succesful product than just code, and that
has always stalled me out from completing any side projects I have made
the past few years. No more! Now I am commiting to learning the parts of
app creation outside of coding with the ultimate goal of shipping a day one
app on VisionOS.

I have several app ideas that I am working on concurrently, which is very
for me. I think some people would have a difficult time context switching
in mutliple projects and prefer to work in one to completion, but I have
always worked on many things at once. In some ways I think it helps me to
do my best work currently (aside from not finishing side projects...). I
am trying to change some bad habits that can cause procrastination and
burnout that have stalled me out before. This blog is one way I hope to
help keep the motivation fresh and maybe cement some things I am learning
as I go.

### Tactics what?

So as I said, I have a few app ideas I am tackling all at once. One of
the most ambitious ones is a AR Tactics game. I am inspired by 2D isometric
"tactics" games that were popular when I had a Gameboy Advance. My personal
favorite was 'Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions'!

I am thinking that remaking this style of game in 3D, and using AR to render
it in your space would be a novel way to re-experiance an old favorite
genre.

### About a game engine
[tutorial series]:https://theliquidfire.com/2015/05/04/tactics-rpg-series-intro/

Apple has announced a lot to do with games this year, including some sort of
path to port Unity projects to VisonOS. I have dabbled with Unity and
Apple's first party SceneKit for 3D apps over the years. Unity has struck
me so far as a more mature / proven solution to build serious games. That
said, so far in my learning journey I am building lots of things I had
thought Unity would provide as an engine, and I think the jury is still
out on whether I will port this project to SceneKit in the future.

Currently though I am giving Unity a fair shake to see if it right for me.
I have even found a [tutorial series] from a few years ago where they build
a 3D Tactics game in Unity! I am killing three birds at least with that
stone: learning Unity, learning C# (csharp), and learning the game's
subsytems that I will have to build.
